# Merkle Patricia Trie Simulator

## Overview
The **Merkle Patricia Trie Simulator** is an interactive tool designed to help developers and blockchain enthusiasts visualize and better understand one of Ethereum's core data structures—the Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT). Given the complexity of this hybrid trie, it can be challenging to grasp its mechanics purely through documentation or conceptual models. This simulator enables users to interact directly with the trie by inserting, updating, and deleting data in real-time, allowing for a deeper understanding through hands-on exploration.

## Features
- **Real-Time Visualization**: As you interact with the trie, the simulator dynamically visualizes the structure, enabling you to observe how the trie nodes and hashes change with each operation.
- **Insert & Update Operations**: Easily add or update key-value pairs in the trie and see how the trie structure adjusts accordingly.
- **Delete Operations**: Remove data from the trie and watch how the structure rebalances itself.
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Simulates the exact behavior of Ethereum’s MPT, the backbone of the state tree in Ethereum.

## Why This Tool?
Ethereum’s Merkle Patricia Trie is essential for maintaining the state of the blockchain and facilitating efficient verification of state transitions. However, its intricate blend of a radix tree and Merkle tree makes it non-trivial to fully understand. This simulator brings the theoretical concepts into the real world, helping you visualize how the MPT evolves with each transaction—enhancing both your knowledge and troubleshooting skills when dealing with Ethereum-based systems.
